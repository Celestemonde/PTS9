## \package pts.visual.do.plot_seds Plot the SEDs produced by one or more SKIRT simulations
#
# This script creates plots of the SEDs produced by one or more SKIRT simulations. It takes the following arguments:
#  - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
#                                                 or "." for the current directory
#  - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
#  - \em instr (string): the name of the instrument to handle; by default handles all instruments in the simulation
#  - \em wmin (float): smallest wavelength on the horizontal axis, in micron; default is 0.1 micron
#  - \em wmax (float): largest wavelength on the horizontal axis, in micron; default is 1000 micron
#  - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades to be plotted on the vertical axis; default is 5
#
# If there is only a single instrument (because the instrument name was specified or because the simulation only has
# one instrument), and the corresponding output file includes the individual flux components, the script creates
# a plot showing all flux components. Otherwise, it creates a plot showing the total flux for all instruments.

# In all cases, the plot file is placed next to the "*_sed.dat" file(s) being represented. The filename starts
# with the simulation prefix and ends with "sed.pdf".
